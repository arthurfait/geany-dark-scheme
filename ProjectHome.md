Please help us extend the geany-dark theme to support new languages! Just create an issue and attach your new filedef file, or just paste into the bottom of the [Contribute wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/geany-dark-scheme/wiki/Contribute). Couldn't be easier :)

Please extend the current theme by using the colors from one of the existing syntax files - that way they all play nice together.
